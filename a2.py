    the number of characters that are not nucleotides and then at the
    end check whether there were more than zero. Another way is to use

    set to False if you found something that wasn't an 'A', 'T', 'C'

    and 'G's, and you should also create examples that contain other
    characters. A string is not a valid DNA sequence if it contains
