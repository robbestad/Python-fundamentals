            A2 Problem Domain: Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA)
        </h3>
        <p>
            The problem domain for A2 is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dna">Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA)</a>, the double-stranded molecule that encodes genetic information for living organisms. DNA is made up of four kinds of <em>nucleotides</em>, which are molecules that bond together to form DNA sequences.
        </p>
        <p>
            The four nucleotides are adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). Each strand of DNA is a sequence of nucleotides, for example AGCTAC. In a program, we will use a string representation of this, <code>"AGCTAC"</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            DNA has 2 strands in a double helix. The nucleotides in one strand are bonded to the nucleotides in the other strand. A and T can be bonded together, and thus <em>complement</em> each other; similarly, C and G are complements of each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can see a picture of this on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dna">the Wikipedia page for DNA</a>. The two strands in DNA are <em>complementary</em> because each nucleotide in one strand is bonded with its complement in the other strand. Thus, given the DNA sequence ACGTACG, its complementary strand is TGCATGC.
        </p>

            Terminology in this handout
        </h3>
        <p>
            A <em>DNA sequence</em> is a sequence of nucleotides, such as TCATGT.

            Once you have finished writing these functions, in IDLE, choose Run -&gt; Run Module. In the shell, test each function by running some example function calls. You can also submit your assignment at this point to see whether you're on the right track: remember, you can submit once every hour up until the deadline. If the example calls return the expected results and you pass all the tests when you submit, move on to Step 3. Otherwise, modify your code and repeat the tests.

            There is no starter code for these functions. Use the design recipe to complete them. We have given you some suggestions for examples to try, but you should come up with more on your own based on the descriptions.

                <td style="width:80%">
                    The parameter is a potential DNA sequence. Return <code>True</code> if and only if the DNA sequence is valid (that is, it contains no characters other than <code>'A'</code>, <code>'T'</code>, <code>'C'</code> and <code>'G'</code>).<br>
                    There are at least 2 ways to approach this. One way is to count the number of characters that are not nucleotides and then at the end check whether there were more than zero. Another way is to use a Boolean variable that represents whether you have found a non-nucleotide character; it would start off as <code>True</code> and would be set to <code>False</code> if you found something that wasn't an <code>'A'</code>, <code>'T'</code>, <code>'C'</code> or <code>'G'</code>.<br>
                    You should construct examples that contain only <code>'A'</code>s, <code>'T'</code>s, <code>'C'</code>s and <code>'G'</code>s, and you should also create examples that contain other characters. A string is not a valid DNA sequence if it contains lowercase letters.

                    The first two parameters are DNA sequences and the third parameter is an index. Return the DNA sequence obtained by inserting the second DNA sequence into the first DNA sequence at the given index. (You can assume that the index is valid.)<br>
                    For example, If you call this function with arguments <code>'CCGG'</code>, <code>'AT'</code>, and <code>2</code>, then it should return <code>'CCATGG'</code>.<br>
                    When coming up with more examples, think about where the second DNA sequence might be inserted: what are the extremes?
